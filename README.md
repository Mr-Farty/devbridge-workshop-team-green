This is a testing sequence for one User.

You should fill in the Missing Data in these fields for test to work:

var username = ""; //USERNAME HERE

var password = ""; //PASSWORD HERE

Even though this test is writen to test non Admin funcionality, you easily can check with different accounts, weather they work the same.
